        <h4>The blog</h4>
        <p>This blog serves many purposes, entitally it was created to practice my python skills,
            mainly aquiring knowledge of the Flask framework. Secondly, it serves as both a way
            for internal learning and external learning. Any knowledge, thoughts, or opinions I share
            here will hopefully serve some purpose to anyone looking to enter the field of not just DevOps,
            but technology in general. The blog helps me stay ontop of personal learning, something
            which can be easily put off once working, whilst also helping me with my report writing. I'm
            forever making mistakes, therefore forever learning, this blog is not neccessary always technology correct,
            my techniques may not be the most effeciant, my views may not be the same views has other people.
            Therefore, I welcome any feedback, whether positive or negative, so please reach out to me on my email
            which will be located in the footer, I'm always happy for a discussion.
